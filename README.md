# AIResearchProject

Abstract:

My project aimed to predict whether a client of a bank has subscribed to a term deposit using the dataset that was provided. The function compare_models() was used to find the best model for the dataset and it was found that the CatBoost Classifier had the best performance. The research project also goes through the different functionalities you can use to manipulate the dataset in Python Pandas. The models were tuned, ensembled, blended, stacked, plotted, and interpreted. Unfortunately, the dashboard functionality did not work with my dataset because display format setting was not compatible. Overall, CatBoost Classifier had the highest accuracy, AUC, recall, etc. and had the best performance compared to the other models that were observed.
